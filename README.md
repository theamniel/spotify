# Spotify-Server

## Socket API

The websocket is available at `ws://localhost:5050/socket`.

Once connected, you will receive `Opcode 1: Hello`.

You should send `Opcode 2: Initialize` immediately after receiving Opcode 1.

### Configuration
It is configured using the file [spotify-server.toml](./bin/spotify-server.toml) to avoid recompiling in exchange of some variable.

Additionally, using `#{var}` replaces it with values that are in the environment variable.

```toml
[server]
host = "localhost"
port = "5050"
token = "#{SPOTIFY_SERVER_TOKEN}"
prefork = false
timeZone = "#{SPOTIFY_SERVER_TIMEZONE}"

[grpc]
host = "localhost"
port = "4040"

[socket]
origins = ["*"]
readBufferSize = 2048
writeBufferSize = 2048

[spotify]
clientID = "#{SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID}"
clientSecret = "#{SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET}"
refreshToken = "#{SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN}"
```

### Events

Events are received on `Opcode 0: Event` - the event type will be part of the root message object under the `t` key.

#### Example Event Message Objects
##### `INITIAL_STATE`
```json
{
  "op": 0,
  "t": "INITIAL_STATE",
  "d": {
    "id": "track id",
    "title": "track title",
    "url": "track url",
    "is_playing": true,
    "artist": {
      "name": "artist name",
      "url": "artist spotify url"
    },
    "album": {
      "id": "album id"
      "name": "album name",
      "url": "album spotify url",
      "art_url": "album art url"
    },
    "timestamp?": {
      "progress": 123,

    }
  }
}
```

##### `TRACK_CHANGE`

```json
{
 "op": 2,
 "t": "TRACK_CHANGE",
 "d": {
  "id": "track id",

}
```

##### `TRACK_PROGRESS`

{
  "op": 2,
  "t": "TRACK_PROGRESS",
  "d": 728
}
```

### Error Codes
Server can disconnect clients for multiple reasons, usually to do with messages being badly formatted. Please refer to your WebSocket client to see how you should handle errors - they do not get received as regular messages.

#### Errors
| Name                    | Code |
| ----------------------- | ---- |
| Invalid/Unknown Opcode  | 4001 |
| Invalid message/payload | 4002 |
| Not Authenticated       | 4003 |
| By Server Request       | 4004 |
| Already authenticated   | 4005 |
